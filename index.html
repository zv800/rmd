<p><span style="color: #999999;">Remote access can also be explained as remote control of a computer by using another device connected via the internet or another network. This is widely used by many computer manufacturers and large businesses' help desks for technical troubleshooting of their customers' problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Remote desktop software captures the mouse and keyboard inputs from the local computer (client) and sends them to the&nbsp;<a style="color: #999999;" title="Remote computer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_computer">remote computer</a>&nbsp;(server).&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a style="color: #999999;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;The remote computer in turn sends the display commands to the local computer. When applications with lots of graphics including video or 3D models need to be controlled remotely, a remote workstation software that sends the pixels rather than the display commands must be used to provide a smooth, like-local experience. HP&nbsp;<a style="color: #999999;" title="Remote Graphics Software" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Graphics_Software">Remote Graphics Software</a>&nbsp;is one such remote workstation solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Remote desktop sharing is accomplished through a common client/server model. The client, or&nbsp;<a style="color: #999999;" title="Virtual Network Computing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing">VNC</a>&nbsp;viewer, is installed on a local computer and then connects via a network to a server component, which is installed on the remote computer. In a typical VNC session, all keystrokes and mouse clicks are registered as if the client were actually performing tasks on the end-user machine.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a style="color: #999999;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">The target computer in a remote desktop scenario is still able to access all of its core functions. Many of these core functions, including the main clipboard, can be shared between the target computer and remote desktop client.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #999999;">A main use of remote desktop software is&nbsp;<a style="color: #999999;" title="Remote administration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_administration">remote administration</a>&nbsp;and remote implementation. This need arises when software buyers are far away from their software vendor. Most remote access software can be used for "<a style="color: #999999;" title="Headless computer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_computer">headless computer</a>s": instead of each computer having its own monitor, keyboard, and mouse, or using a&nbsp;<a style="color: #999999;" title="KVM switch" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM switch</a>, one computer can have a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and remote control software, and control many headless computers. The duplicate desktop mode is useful for user support and education. Remote control software combined with&nbsp;<a style="color: #999999;" title="Telephone" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone">telephone</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">communication can be nearly as helpful for novice computer-users as if the support staff were actually there.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Since the advent of&nbsp;<a style="color: #999999;" title="Cloud computing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud computing</a>&nbsp;remote desktop software can be housed on&nbsp;<a style="color: #999999;" title="USB mass storage device class" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_mass_storage_device_class">USB hardware devices</a>, allowing users to connect the device to any PC connected to their network or the Internet and recreate their desktop via a connection to the cloud. This model avoids one problem with remote desktop software, which requires the local computer to be switched on at the time when the user wishes to access it remotely. (It is possible with a router with C2S VPN support, and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" style="color: #999999;" title="Wake on LAN" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_on_LAN">Wake on LAN</a>&nbsp;equipment, to establish a&nbsp;<a style="color: #999999;" title="Virtual private network" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">virtual private network</a>&nbsp;(VPN) connection with the router over the Internet if not connected to the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" style="color: #999999;" title="LAN" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN">LAN</a>, switch on a computer connected to the router, then connect to it.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Remote desktop products are available in three models: hosted service, software, and appliance.</span></p>
